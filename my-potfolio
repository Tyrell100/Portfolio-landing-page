        <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an 18 year old coding student at Moringa School who has recently completed my high school education(844).I have a passion for coding and majored my high school IT project on maximising the use of visual basic codes.In so doing i was able to attain an A in the project itslef.I decided to take up coding because from the first time I interacted with computers I was greatly intrigued in the blend of art science and creativity behind the creation of the codes to run software.My love for coding is also driven by my other passion and hobby, gaming.I took up coding so as to one day dive into the unventured world of creating games. My current interests include listening to music, playing basketball and gaming.I look foward to completing my in depth studies of coding so as to be able to spearhead a revolutional generation of IT in my country.</p>
